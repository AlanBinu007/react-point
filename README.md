# react-point

[`react-point`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-point) is a minimal click/tap detector component for React.

## Installation

Using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/):

    $ npm install --save react-point

Then with a module bundler like [webpack](https://webpack.github.io/), use as you would anything else:

```js
// using an ES6 transpiler, like babel
import Point from 'react-point'

// not using an ES6 transpiler
var Point = require('react-point')
```

The UMD build is also available on [npmcdn](https://npmcdn.com):

```html
<script src="https://npmcdn.com/react-point/umd/react-point.min.js"></script>
```

You can find the library on `window.ReactPoint`.
